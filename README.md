<H2>FFA Removal from Edible Oils Analysis - Dashboard</H2>
<p>This project showcases an end-to-end data analysis workflow for understanding Free Fatty Acid (FFA) removal efficiency</p>
<p>
  Using the dataset consisting of simulating batch-wise deodorization operations data, I have built a comprehensive dashboard to evaluate:
  <ul>
    <li>Initial and Final FFA levels.</li>
    <li>Average FFA removal, deo time, and yield</li>
    <li>Effect of temperature on operations</li>
    <li>FFA removal (%) with Batch id</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>This dashboard reflects real industrial scenarios in edible oil processing for FFA removal.</p>
