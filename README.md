<H2>FFA Removal from Edible Oils Analysis - Dashboard</H2>
<p>This project showcases an end-to-end data analysis workflow for understanding Free Fatty Acid (FFA) removal efficiency</p>
<ul>
  <li>Collected batch-wise process data (Initial FFA, Final FFA, Temperature, Yield, Deo Time, etc.)</li>
  <li>Cleaned inconsistent values, handled missing entries, standardized units.</li>
  <li> Performed EDA to analyze relationships between operating parameters and FFA removal.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Using the dataset consisting of simulating batch-wise deodorization operations data, designed a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI to evaluate:
  <ul type='circle'>
    <li>Average KPI summaries</li>
    <li>Effect of temperature on operations</li>
    <li>FFA removal efficiency across batches</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>This dashboard reflects real industrial scenarios in edible oil processing for FFA removal.</p>

<p>Also, created weekly reports summarizing trends & deviations.</p>
